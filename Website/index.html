        <p>Hello! This website is my exhibition project, which is going to be an interactive website that can help students with studying. So far, I've added addition problems as a test, as well as power rule derivative and antiderivative practice. These math questions are randomly-generated, with each numerical value in the question being a random number between 1 and 10. There are also pages for science and spanish studying, but I haven't added anything to them yet besides a basic test question.</p>
