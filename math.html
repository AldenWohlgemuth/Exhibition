        <p>This is the homepage for the math studying portion of the website. It currently has practice for power, chain rule, sine, and cosine deriving, as well as polynomial, natural log, and chain rule integration. There are currently some issues with recognizing answers in different formats (for instance, I still haven't programmed it to register simplified fractions as correct). Additionally, I need to change both the display and answer to not display values raised to the zeroeth or first power.</p>
