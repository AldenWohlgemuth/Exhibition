        <p>Hello! This website is my exhibition project, which is going to be an interactive website that can help students with studying calculus. So far, I've added practice for power rule, chain rule, sine, and cosine deriving, as well as polynomial, natural log, chain rule, sine, and cosine integration. These math questions are randomly-generated, with each numerical value in the question being a randomly-generated integer. My next step is to fix issues with acceptable answer formats (namely, simplified fractions are marked wrong) Additionally, formatting for the site as a whole is unfinished, so I am planning to improve it once I finish making the questions function properly.</p>
