        <p id="introduction">Hello! This website is my exhibition project, which is going to be an interactive website that can help students with studying calculus. So far, I've added practice for:<br><br> - Power rule, chain rule, sine, and cosine deriving<br> - Polynomial, natural log, chain rule, sine, and cosine integration<br><br>These math questions are randomly-generated, with each numerical value in the question being a randomly-generated integer. My next steps are to:<br><br> - Fix issues with acceptable answer formats, especially issues with parentheses in chain and trig problems.<br> - Improve formatting for the website as a whole<br> - Add links to images to allow them to be used for navigation<br> - Add additional subjects to study</p>
        <!--Pictures that will be used for navigation-need to make them appear side-by-side and cite them-->
