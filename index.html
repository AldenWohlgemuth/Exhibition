        <p>Hello! This website is my exhibition project, which is going to be an interactive website that can help students with studying calculus. So far for math practice, I've added practice for power rule, chain rule, sine, and cosine deriving, as well as polynomial, natural log, and chain rule integration. These math questions are randomly-generated, with each numerical value in the question being a random number between 3 and 5 for deriving and 3 to 9 for antideriving (the minimum value of 3 is due to issues display exponent answers). My next step is to fix issues with acceptable answer formats (namely, simplified fractions are marked wrong) Additionally, formatting for the site as a whole is unfinished, so I am planning to improve it once I finish making the questions function properly.</p>
