Hello! This website is my exhibition project, which is an interactive website that can help students with studying calculus. So far, I've added practice for power rule, chain rule, sine, and cosine deriving, as well as polynomial, natural log, chain rule, sine, and cosine integration. These math questions are randomly-generated, with each numerical value in the question being a a randomly-generated integer.
TO-DO:<br>
 - Allow pressing enter to submit answer as well as pressing the submit button<br>
 - Save response and then re-print it so it doesn't reset when enter is pressed<br>
 - Show previous questions and answers at the bottom of the page<br>
 - Add more topics to study<br>
 - Improve formatting for user inputs<br>
 - Improve formatting for website<br>
