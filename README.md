Hello! This website is my exhibition project, which is going to be an interactive website that can help students with studying. So far for math practice, I've added addition problems as a test, as well as power rule derivative, antiderivative, and integration problems. These math questions are randomly-generated, with each numerical value in the question being a random number between 1 and 10. For Spanish, I've added 10 vocabulary questions where you have to translate each word to English. By using arrays, it is possible to loop through these questions infinitely, and I've ensured that you can't get the same question twice in a row. Currently, science studying only has a single test question and beyond that is nonfunctional. My next goal is to figure out how to add accents for Spanish questions, and how to add diagrams for science problems. Additionally, formatting for the site as a whole is unfinished, so I am planning to improve it once I finish making the questions function properly.
