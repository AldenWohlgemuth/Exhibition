Hello! This website is my exhibition project, which is an interactive website that can help students with studying calculus. So far, I've added practice for power rule, chain rule, sine, and cosine deriving, as well as polynomial, natural log, chain rule, sine, and cosine integration. These math questions are randomly-generated, with each numerical value in the question being a a randomly-generated integer. My next step is to fix issues with acceptable answer formats, especially issues with parentheses in chain and trig problems. Additionally, formatting for the site as a whole is unfinished, so I am planning to improve it once I finish making the questions function properly.
Additional TO-DO:<br>
-Increase area of text background<br>
-Allow pressing enter to submit answer as well as pressing the submit button<br>
-Show previous questions and answers at the bottom of the page<br>
-Add more topics to study<br>
-Save response and then re-print it so it doesn't reset when enter is pressed<br>
-Add pictures to homepage that can be used for navigation<br>
-Fix code for making chain rule numbers more managable<br>
-Cite images used<br>
