This is a website I am designing for my exhibition project. I'm planning for it to be a website you can use to quiz yourself on various subjects.
- So far, I've programmed addition problems as a test, as well as practice with deriving and antideriving.
- I still need to figure out how to display exponents, as well as accept fractions as an answer (the fact that fractions are not an acceptable answer means that antiderivative practice is still not 100% functional)
